# MeteoHist - Historical Temperature Graph

## A streamlit app to create temperature graphs for places around the world.

This app allows to create temperature graphs that compare the **mean temperature** of a given location to the mean temperature of a **reference period**.

The reference period **defaults to 1961-1990** which [according](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/it%E2%80%99s-warmer-average-what-average) to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is currently the **best "long-term climate change assessment"**. Other reference periods of 30 years each can be selected, too.

The **peaks** on the graph show how the displayed year's temperatures deviate from the mean of the reference period. The more and the higher the red peaks, the more "hotter days than usual" have been observed. The blue peaks indicate days colder than the historical mean.

The plot is created using Python's **Matplotlib** library.

### Data

To create the graph, temperature data from the open-source weather API [**Open-Meteo**](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api) is used. According to them, "the Historical Weather API is based on **reanalysis datasets** and uses a **combination of weather station, aircraft, buoy, radar, and satellite observations** to create a comprehensive record of past weather conditions. These datasets are able to **fill in gaps by using mathematical models** to estimate the values of various weather variables. As a result, reanalysis datasets are able to provide detailed historical weather information for **locations that may not have had weather stations nearby**, such as rural areas or the open ocean."

To get location data (lat/lon) for the input location, [**Openstreetmap's Nominatim**](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) is used.

### Try it

You can try the app at [https://yotka.org/meteo-hist/](https://yotka.org/meteo-hist/)

To use the app on your machine, there are two simple ways:

**1. Set up a Python environment, clone the repository, and run app.py using streamlit:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yotkadata/meteo_hist/
cd meteo_hist/
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

This should open a page in your default browser at http://localhost:8501 that shows the app.

**2. Set up Docker and run it in a container (you can change the name and the tag, of course):**

```bash
docker build -t meteo_hist:latest github.com/yotkadata/meteo_hist
docker run -d --name meteo_hist -p 8501:8501 meteo_hist:latest
```

Then open http://localhost:8501 or http://0.0.0.0:8501/ in your browser to see the app.

To save the generated files outside the Docker container, you can add a binding to a folder on your hard drive when you start the container:
(replace `/home/user/path/output/` with the path to the folder to be used).

```bash
docker run -d --name meteo_hist -p 8501:8501 -v /home/user/path/output/:/app/output meteo_hist:latest
```

### Thanks

- This app was inspired by [plots](https://twitter.com/dr_xeo/status/1656933695511511043) made by [Dr. Dominic Roy√©](https://github.com/dominicroye) - thanks for the idea and the exchange about it.
